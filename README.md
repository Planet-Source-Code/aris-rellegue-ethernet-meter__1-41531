## Ethernet Meter


</div>

### Description

Displays the current amount of traffic in the first Ethernet card it finds.

This code was written to monitor my ADSL usage.

It is still a work in progress. Also, because the data is measured in packets and I don't know the size of a packet therefore I multiplied the packet size with MTU to get the number of bytes.

I check the result with netstat and values are close enough.

Any comment or suggestion is greatly appreciated.
